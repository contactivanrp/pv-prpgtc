									<p>If a whistle-blower believes that he or she is being subjected to discrimination, retaliation or harassment for having made a report under this Policy, he or she should immediately report those facts to his or her immediate superior or follow the procedure for reporting under this Policy promptly to facilitate investigation and the taking of appropriate action.</p>

								<h3>Procedure On Whistle-blowing</h3>
								<div class="g-para-group">
									<p>Staff of PRPTC may make the report to his or her immediate supervisor or to the Secretary of PRPTC. If the report is made to the immediate supervisor of the staff, the immediate supervisor shall also report the matter to the Secretary of PRPTC, Chairman of PRPTC Audit Committee or the Chairman of PRPTC.</p>
									<p>Alternatively, any person covered by this Policy may make the report to the Secretary of PRPTC, Chairman of PRPTC Audit Committee or the Chairman of PRPTC. All reports shall be made via email to whistleblow@prpg-tc.org.sg which will only be accessed by the Secretary of PRPTC, Chairman of PRPTC Audit Committee and the Chairman of PRPTC.</p>
									<p>The Chairman of PRPTC together with the Chairman of PRPTC Audit Committee and the Secretary of PRPTC shall decide as to whether an investigation on the report made by the whistle-blower should proceed or no further action is considered necessary.</p>
									<p>For effective review and subsequent investigation, all whistle-blowers are encouraged to provide as much information and be as specific as possible in his or her report, including his or her contact details, in case further information or clarification is required. All reports and the identity of the whistle-blowers shall be treated with confidentiality.</p>
									<p>If there is a prima facie case, a thorough investigation will be conducted. However, there may be circumstances where there is insufficient evidence to proceed, especially in the case of anonymous reporting. In cases where an investigation is proceeded with, the person conducting the investigation will keep the whistle-blower informed (where he or she is identifiable) of the progress of the investigation. Where the whistle-blower is identifiable, but a decision is made not to proceed with an investigation, the Secretary of PRPTC, Chairman of PRPTC Audit Committee or the Chairman of PRPTC should advise the whistle-blower that there will be no investigation with reasons for the decision.</p>
									<p>After making the report, the whistle-blower should refrain from confronting the person being reported or making further investigation. The investigation team may ask the whistle-blower for further information or clarification.</p>
									<p>After the decision is made to proceed with an investigation, all reports made shall be investigated as soon as possible and should be resolved and the details of the investigation reported to the Chairman of PRPTC within three months of receiving the whistle-blower’s report.</p>
									<p>All investigation reports upon completion are to be retained at the Office of the Chairman of PRPTC to ensure confidentiality as well as for future reference.</p>
